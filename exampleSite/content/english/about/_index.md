## ABOUT ME

Hi!  I'm Andrea, the founder of Account Ways and Andrea Daniel CPA, PLLC.  I hold a Master of Science Degree in Finance from Bentley University, and I have been a Certified Public Accountant in North Carolina since 1999.  

I am a finance professional with 25+ years of experience in accounting, financial analysis and taxation in the technology, manufacturing, banking, and utility industries with expertise in financial analysis, forecasting, and financial modeling â€“ digging through detailed financial data (at the transaction level) to find drivers and key indicators and then summarizing at a high level for financial reports.  I first started using QuickBooks when I taught a QuickBooks class at a local community college fifteen years ago.  I am now a certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor and QuickBooks Payroll provider.  I also have 20 years of experience preparing income tax returns and currently "moonlight" as a seasonal tax expert with Intuit.

While I enjoyed my many years of corporate accounting/finance experience, my passion is helping "regular people", individuals and small business owners, navigate the intricacies and nuances of bookkeeping and tax code.  I am finally at a point in my career where I can shift my focus and use my knowledge and talent to help small business owners realize their dreams, and I am excited about it.
